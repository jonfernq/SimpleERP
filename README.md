## SimpleERP
Conceptually simple ERP with data and business processes explained with diagrams.

Initially, two simple user interfaces or data input modes with data validation exist: 1. CSV file, and 2. Command Line Interface (CLI).  Additional more sophisticated user interfaces in React.js and Pynecone (Python-React,js) are planned after this. 

API's are provided which are fed business transactions via CSV files as input data. As output data, system reports and dashboard graphics are rendered to output files (and D3.js for browser graphics). 

Common business sub-systems in an ERP system are listed by the order of how essential and important they are to business operations.
