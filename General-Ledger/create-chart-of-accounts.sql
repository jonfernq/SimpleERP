/* The Accounts table must have a tree structure of subsidiary accounts rolling up to higher-level accounts, with lowest-level journal entry accounts for posting journal entries, the structure that is typically found in a company's Chart of Accounts. */ 

/* A Chart of Accounts (CoA) is a hierarchical list of the financial accounts of a company, with the highest level being the main accounts and the lowest level being the subsidiary accounts. To implement a Chart of Accounts in a relational database, you would need to create a table that has a parent-child relationship between the accounts. */ 

/* Here is an example of the SQL CREATE code for the Accounts table with a tree structure of subsidiary accounts: */ 

CREATE TABLE Accounts (
    AccountID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ParentAccountID INT,
    AccountName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    AccountType VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (ParentAccountID) REFERENCES Accounts(AccountID)
);

/* This table will hold the different types of accounts in the Chart of Accounts, such as main accounts, subsidiary accounts and lowest-level journal entry accounts. The AccountID is the primary key, AccountName and AccountType are the columns that store the name and type of the account respectively, the ParentAccountID is a foreign key referencing the parent account in the table. */ 

/* You can use the parent-child relationship to create the hierarchical structure of the Chart of Accounts, with the main accounts having a null ParentAccountID and the subsidiary accounts having a ParentAccountID referencing the main account they belong to. */ 

/* You can still use the Journal and JournalEntries tables as described in the previous answer, but you need to adjust the foreign key referencing the Accounts table to reference the AccountID of the lowest level journal entry accounts. */ 

CREATE TABLE JournalEntries (
    JournalEntryID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    JournalID INT NOT NULL,
    AccountID INT NOT NULL,
    Debit DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    Credit DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (JournalID) REFERENCES Journal(JournalID),
    FOREIGN KEY (AccountID) REFERENCES Accounts(AccountID)
);

/* It's important to note that this is a simple example and the specific requirements for a Chart of Accounts will vary depending on the company's needs and regulations, so it's always best to consult with an accountant or financial expert to ensure compliance with accounting standards and regulations. */
